The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language used to represent system structures and behaviors. In 2005, UML was officially published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard. While UML is a standardized way to visualize system design, it is primarily used in software development.
